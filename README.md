# Design and implementation of an unmanned aerial vehicle based on the ESP8266 microcontroller

The engineering thesis is based on the design and construction of an unmanned aerial vehicle in the form of a quadrocopter, using a microcontroller from the ESP8266 family. The theoretical part concerns the principle of operation of multicopters, and also presents the basic components from which they are built. The principles that guided the selection of individual components were discussed there. Next, the computer software that contributed to the project is described. The part devoted to the control system describes the aspects of designing and then implementing the electrical system, as well as the process of creating software controlling the system. The mechanical layout chapter focuses on designing and building the frame, putting all the components together, and testing the finished model. Finally, a partially working prototype of the unmanned aerial vehicle was created. The analysis of the results is discussed in the summary, as well as in the quadrocopter test section.
